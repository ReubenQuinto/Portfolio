Objective:
	- The objective is to create an automated sales dashboard.

The Solution:
	- I used Power Query to read in the data. Used Data Model & Power Pivot to roll-up the data. Use slicers to allow users to interact with the data. Finally, created 2 VBA/Macros to refresh the pivot tables and export the graphs to Power Point.

Key Takeaways:
	- This is how a data pipeline is created using Excel.
	- In order to use the Power Point macro you must have specific settings activated.
