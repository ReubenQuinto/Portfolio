Objective: 
	- The objective is to find Sheet 2 column A text (key) and replace it with Sheet 2 column B text (value) as it occurs in Sheet 1 column A (<ticker>).

The Solution: 
	- The problem is centered around dates.
	- The solution is to create dynamically adjusting dates using nested Excel formulas and passing in list/arrays.
